Folder: Hw4 Cache Simulator

Homework Name: Cache Simulator

Homework Description: Build a simulator that reads a memory trace and simulates the action of a ‘ write-through with write-allocate ’ cache. The replacement policy is LRU (Least Recently used) when all the blocks in the set are valid. The configuration of the cache is as follows: Size : 4096KB, Block Size : 16B, Associativity : Two-way, Address Size : 32 Bits. Please refer to "homework description.pdf" for more details.

How to compile and run in Linux:
Download the files into a folder.
In the terminal, change the directory to that folder.
Type "make" to compile the code.
And then type “./memsim <input_trace_file_name>” to run the program.

Program Output: Please refer to "program output.pdf"

Folder: Hw5 MIPS Simulator

Homework Name: MIPS Simulator

Homework Description: 
The implementation for this HW is divided into two parts:
1. MIPS simulator without Pipelining.
2. MIPS simulator with 3-stage Pipelining and Data Forwarding.
Please refer to "homework description.pdf" for more details.

How to compile and run in Linux:
Download the files into a folder.
In the terminal, change the directory to that folder.
Type "make" to compile the code.
And then type “./mips <input_file> clock_time” to run the program.

Program Output: Please refer to "program output.pdf"
